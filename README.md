# ZSnow
This is a basic XSnow clone written in zig for wayland. 
Since I swaped to sway I was missing the xsnow experience, so I created my own one.
I don't care about most features xsnow has, such as snow piling up or the santa and trees,
so they are not planned.


## Disclaimer
Since I'm new to zig and co, the code might contain alot of errors.
For now I can't see any huge memory leaks or issues, but when I find some
I will fix them, feel free to open an issue.
